# Mancala
#### A C++ command line Mancala program.

A collaboration between me and my brother.

Currently supports Player vs. Player, Player vs. AI, and AI vs. AI.

AI vs. AI supports choosing different search depths for each AI. A depth of below 10 is recommended, as the amount of RAM and the time it takes to find a move increases exponentially with the depth.
